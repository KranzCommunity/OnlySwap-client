Instead, You and OnlySwap agree to arbitrate Disputes that are not resolved informally (as described below) through binding arbitration (i.e. the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it) instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).</p>
        <p class="terms-text">No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions - You and OnlySwap agree that any dispute is personal to You and OnlySwap and that any such dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. Neither party agrees to class arbitration or to an arbitration in which an individual attempt to resolve a dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals.

        <p class="terms-text">Process - You and OnlySwap agree that each will notify the other, in writing, of any Dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises so that the parties can attempt, in good faith, to resolve the Dispute informally.

You and OnlySwap agree that any arbitration or claim must be commenced or filed within one (1) year after the Dispute arose; otherwise, You and OnlySwap agree that the claim is permanently barred (which means that You will no longer have the right to assert a claim regarding the Dispute).</p>

You further agree that the Platform shall be deemed to be based solely in the state of Texas and that, although the Platform may be available in other jurisdictions, its availability does not give rise to general or specific personal jurisdiction in any forum outside of the state of Texas.</p>

As limited by these Terms and applicable arbitration rules, the arbitrator will have: (a) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute; and (b) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court.
